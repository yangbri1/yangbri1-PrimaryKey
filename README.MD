# Background
SQL sublanguage: DDL (Data Definition Language)
 
A primary key is a constraint that we can add to a column that labels that column as the unique identifier for a record in the table.
 
Primary Keys are `UNIQUE` and `NOT NULL` implicitly.
 
There are 3 types of Primary Keys:
- `Surrogate Key`: The primary key is autogenerated by the database (this is the type of primary key we will be working with).
- `Natural Key`: The primary key is naturally generated by the outside world.
- `Composite Key`: They combination of 2 or more columns generates a unique identifier which you can utilize as the primary key.
 
Since we will only be utilizing surrogate keys throughout pre-training, lets look at how the syntax will be.
 
Let's say we want to create a "site_user" table that has the following columns:

|   id  |      username        |        password         |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------|
|1      |"user1"               |"pass123"                |
|2      |"user2"               |"pass123"                |
|3      |"user3"               |"pass123"                |

The SQL syntax would be as follows:
```roomsql
CREATE TABLE site_user (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     username varchar(100),
     password varchar(100)
);
```

The datatype `SERIAL` is an int that will autogenerate a unique number for us.
The constraint `PRIMARY KEY` identifies the id column as the primary key column.

## Problem 1
song table
|   id  |      title        |        artist         |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------------|
|1      |'Let it be'        |'Beatles'              |
|2      |'Hotel California' |'Eagles'               | 
|3      |'Kashmir'          |'Led Zeppelin'         |

#### Problem 1: Create a table called "song" that has 3 columns listed above. Column id should be the `PRIMARY KEY`
